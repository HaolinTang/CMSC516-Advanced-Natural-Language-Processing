# CMSC516-Advanced-Natural-Language-Processing
This is a repository includes the sentiment analysis project implementation of CMSC516_Advanced NLP.

## Authors
Lavanya Thollamadugu and Haolin Tang Group Project at Virginia Commonwealth University.

## Overview
In this project, we will build a logistics regression (LR) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. First, we will download the IMDB movie reviews and conduct the data preprocessing. Second, a LR model and a LSTM will be trained and tested. In addition, the performance of these two models will be compared. Third, we will apply the Twitter API to collect some tweets mentioning a specific movie and then feed them to the LR and LSTM models. Last, we will investigate the sentiment analysis results on the tweets.        

## Installation 



## Data
The [IMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lakshmi25npathi/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-movie-reviews/data) consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews. This dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing. Twitter API Framework.
